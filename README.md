# Dogfood.CSharp

This is a scratch repo for all of my Xamarin experiments. Mostly to screw around with new APIs and break VS for Mac and the SDKs.

For the Xamarin.iOS solution, you must use the [Xamarin.iOS 10.99.x+](https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Xamarin.MaciOS/job/xamarin-macios-builds-xcode9/), as I am using iOS 11 features. Some of the view controllers are ports from other people's projects (originally written in Swift or Objective C), some are mine, and some are a mix!
